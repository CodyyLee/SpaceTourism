## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Router

### Continued development

Moving forward, I'm going to rethink the way that I do styling. I am confident that this could have been accomplished with significantly less CSS. Looking back on it, I feel I could have made a reusable component for the pages outside of the homepage as well. I'm going to play around a lot more with CSS Grid and also give Tailwind a proper run.
